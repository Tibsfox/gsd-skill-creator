# GSD Skill Creator

## What This Is

A self-evolving skill ecosystem for Claude Code that observes usage patterns, suggests skill creation, composes related skills into purpose-built agents, and automatically promotes deterministic operations to context-bypassing scripts. It provides the learning and evolution layer alongside GSD (Get Shit Done), transforming it from a static workflow engine into a self-improving one through a six-step loop: observe, detect, suggest, apply, learn, compose — with an integrated promotion pipeline that progresses operations from conversational through skill to compiled execution. Includes a unified development dashboard with live planning docs, real-time metrics, an embedded browser terminal, and a bidirectional console for uploading vision documents, configuring milestone settings, and answering structured planning questions via filesystem message bus. A staging layer sits between human ideation and machine execution — scanning content for security hygiene, analyzing resource needs, checking derived knowledge integrity, and managing a queue for parallel execution with pre-wired skills and topology recommendations. Skills are distributable across platforms via MCP protocol and portable agentskills.io format.

## Core Value

Skills, agents, and teams must match official Claude Code patterns so they work correctly when loaded by Claude Code.

### Active

<!-- Next milestone requirements — see REQUIREMENTS.md -->

(None yet — run `/gsd:new-milestone` to define next milestone)

### Out of Scope

- Full-stack web application — Dashboard and terminal are local dev tools, not a deployed app
- Real-time collaboration — Single-user tool
- Cloud-hosted skill registry — Local filesystem + optional MCP server; existing marketplaces serve this need
- Breaking changes to existing skill format — Additive only, backward compatible
- Non-Claude-Code agent frameworks — Focus on Claude Code ecosystem, portability is export-only
- LLM API calls for query routing — Latency, cost, external dependency for every skill search
- Platform-specific skill content — Agent Skills standard is universal; only frontmatter varies by platform
- ML-based detection — v1 uses pattern matching and heuristics; ML adds complexity without proven need
- Automated remediation — v1 flags and suggests; auto-fix requires high confidence not yet established
- Cross-project staging — v1 is project-scoped; cross-project adds significant coordination complexity

## Current State

v1.19 shipped. 23 milestones shipped (v1.0-v1.19 + v1.8.1 patch), 151 phases, 437 plans, ~192k LOC TypeScript. Budget display now correctly separates installed skill inventory from loading projection with tier-based simulation. CLI status shows two-section layout with proportional sizing and color-coded budget bar. Dashboard gauge renders loading projection with deferred tooltip and clamped over-budget display. Cumulative budgets are configurable per agent profile in integration config with env var backward compatibility. Budget history tracks installed and loaded totals separately with graceful migration of old snapshots.

## Context

- Built with TypeScript, Vitest for testing, Zod for validation
- ~192,000 LOC across 23 milestones (v1.0-v1.19 + v1.8.1)
- Uses HuggingFace transformers for local embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Natural.js for Bayes classification in orchestrator
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for MCP server
- modern-tar for skill packaging
- simple-statistics for A/B evaluation t-tests
- Agent Skills specification (agentskills.io) is the portable format standard
- Skills work across Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI
- 7 team topologies supported: leader-worker, pipeline, swarm, custom, router, map-reduce
- Pre-existing tech debt: orchestrator fixture tests (path resolution), disclosure integration test (type cast), test-runner BatchSimulator mock, manifest.test.ts compilation warnings (7 missing contentHash)

## Constraints

- **Backward compatibility**: All new features must not break existing skill format (additive extensions only)
- **Token efficiency**: Generated skills must respect progressive disclosure — under 5,000 words in SKILL.md
- **Local-first**: No mandatory cloud dependencies; MCP integration is optional
- **Test-driven**: TDD with RED-GREEN cycle; all new features require comprehensive tests
- **Claude Code native**: All skills must be valid Agent Skills standard files

## Key Decisions

|----------|-----------|---------|
| Extension fields under metadata.extensions.gsd-skill-creator | Namespaced to avoid conflicts with standard fields | ✓ Good |

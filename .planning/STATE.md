## Current Position

Milestone: v1.16 -- Dashboard Console & Milestone Ingestion
Phase: 131-question-system (plan 02 complete)
Status: Executing phase 131

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Skills, agents, and teams must match official Claude Code patterns so they work correctly when loaded by Claude Code
**Current focus:** v1.16 — Dashboard Console & Milestone Ingestion

## Accumulated Context

### Config
- Mode: yolo
- Depth: comprehensive
- Model profile: quality (opus executors)
- Parallelization: enabled
- commit_docs: false

### Key Decisions
- Used z.string().regex(/^\//) for base_path validation (reliable across Zod versions)
- auth_mode uses z.enum(['none']) for forward-extensibility to ['none', 'token']
- No changes needed to reader.ts -- safeParse automatically includes terminal section
- Non-detached spawn for Wetty (dies with parent, avoids orphans)
- Native fetch with AbortSignal.timeout() for health check (no external HTTP libs)
- Compound tmux command (attach || new) for Wetty --command flag
- Constructor injection for DashboardService generator function
- Promise.allSettled for DevEnvironmentManager concurrent operations
- AbortController for file watcher lifecycle in DashboardService
- id regex ^msg-\d{8}-\d{3,}$ for envelope ids (3+ digit seq for growth)
- z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()) for message payload (any object shape)
- Promise.all for parallel console directory creation
- jq required as runtime dependency for bash JSON parsing in check-inbox.sh
- Malformed JSON files moved to acknowledged/ to prevent infinite retry loops
- set -euo pipefail for strict bash error handling in scripts
- Embedded client-side extractMetadata mirrors server-side extractDocumentMetadata for isomorphic parsing
- SVG icon for upload zone (not emoji) for accessibility and theme consistency
- color-mix() CSS function for drag-active background tint
- Mock IncomingMessage/ServerResponse for helper tests (no real HTTP server needed)
- CORS * since localhost-only is a server-level concern, not router concern
- handleRequest returns boolean for route passthrough composability
- Subdirectory allowlist via Set (inbox/pending, config, uploads) -- explicit, no regex bypass risk
- Explicit section-level defaults in Zod schema (not empty objects) to ensure nested defaults apply correctly
- mergeDefaults() function for shallow+nested merge of partial config overrides in form renderer
- appendFile for JSONL concurrent safety (atomic for small writes, one line per entry)
- Cached mkdir (dirEnsured flag) to avoid redundant filesystem calls after first logger write
- safeLog wrapper swallows logger errors to prevent HTTP 500 from audit logging
- Component composition via function calls for submit flow (renderUploadZone + renderConfigForm inlined)
- setInterval polling at 500ms for submit readiness check (avoids cross-component event coupling)
- Two-stage fetch pattern: config write first, milestone-submit message only on config success
- Skill references scripts by relative path (scripts/console/*.sh) for project portability
- Content quality enforced at <5000 words and 3+ sections via test suite
- jq --argjson for progress field ensures numeric type in JSON output (write-status.sh)
- Timestamp colons replaced with hyphens in question filenames for filesystem safety
- validate-config.sh checks only milestone.name and milestone.submitted_at as required fields
- Pure function dispatch for message handler (no side effects, no filesystem)
- Discriminated union MessageAction type for structured return values
- StatusWriter overwrites current.json each time (always reflects current state)
- Boolean(payload.hot) defaults to false when hot flag not specified in config-update
- Type aliases inferred from schema via z.infer indexed access (not separate type definitions) for QuestionSchema
- TimeoutFallback extracted via NonNullable<Question['timeout']>['fallback'] for DRY type inference
- Options structurally optional in schema -- renderer enforces semantic requirement for choice/multi-select
- Binary and confirmation types render direct action buttons (no separate submit button)
- Choice, multi-select, text types include submit button in actions bar
- Urgency conveyed via left border color (dim/accent/orange/red) with critical background tint
- Timeout formatted as Xm Ys for >= 60s, Xs for < 60s

### Architecture Notes
- Dashboard module: src/dashboard/ (parser, renderer, generator, structured-data, incremental, refresh, collectors, metrics, terminal-panel, terminal-integration, upload-zone, config-form, submit-flow, question-card)
- Terminal module: src/terminal/ (launcher, health, process-manager, session, types, index)
- Launcher module: src/launcher/ (dashboard-service, dev-environment, types, index)
- Console module: src/console/ (message types/schemas, reader, writer, message-handler, status-writer, helper endpoint, bridge-logger, question-schema, check-inbox integration tests)
- Scripts module: scripts/console/ (check-inbox.sh, write-question.sh, write-status.sh, validate-config.sh)
- gsd-stack session management: bash scripts with tmux integration (v1.13)
- v1.14 promotion pipeline: src/pipeline/ + src/dashboard/collectors/
- 19 milestones shipped, 127 phases, 362 plans, ~149k LOC
- Filesystem message bus at .planning/console/ (inbox/outbox/config/uploads/logs)
- Helper endpoint (Express) mounted alongside dashboard, localhost-only
- No WebSockets -- dashboard polls outbox at 2-3s intervals

### Todos
- (none)

### Blockers

# tools/pre-tag-gate.sh — pre-tag composite gate for v1.49.x ships.
#
# Run BEFORE `git tag` to catch CI-shaped failures that the lighter
# pre-push hook does not exercise. Composes:
#
#   1. npm run build  — catches TypeScript errors (e.g. TS2835 missing-.js
#                       extensions) that vitest does not surface
#   2. npx vitest run — runs the full vitest suite, mirroring CI
#   3. node tools/release-history/check-completeness.mjs --current --strict
#                     — release-notes 5-file structure (already enforced by
#                       the pre-push hook on push-to-main, but re-checked
#                       here so the operator sees the gate fire pre-tag)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all checks PASS
#   1  build failed
#   2  vitest failed
#   3  completeness gate failed
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/pre-tag-gate.sh
#   npm run pre-tag-gate
#
# Why this gate exists:
#   v1.49.585 shipped with CI red on dev (run 25096343019) and main
#   (run 25096349789). 1 build error + 4 test failures, all
#   v1.49.585-introduced. The W4 Phase 3 meta-test only ran completeness +
#   chapter idempotent + pre-push BLOCK/ALLOW; CI-shaped tests slipped
#   through. Forward lesson #10176 captured the gap; this script closes it.
#
# Authored 2026-04-29 in v1.49.585+ post-ship CI-fix follow-up.
